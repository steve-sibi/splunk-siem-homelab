# splunk-siem-homelab

# Overview
This was a personal project of mine I wanted to take on to build experience in architecting and using Splunk in a simulated environment. This guide walks through setting up a SIEM+SOAR homelab using Splunk Enterprise 9.4.1 and Splunk SOAR 6.4.0 on a local VMware environment.  I will cover the lab requirements, installation steps, log forwarding configuration, data ingestion, building dashboards, writing correlation searches (SPL queries), and designing simple SOAR playbooks. Screenshots will be added later for clarity.
